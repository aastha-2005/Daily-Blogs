# 📝 Daily Blogs Webpage

This is a **basic visual design-only project** of a Daily Blogs Webpage created as part of my web development learning journey. It is **not connected to any backend or database**, and focuses entirely on layout and responsiveness using **HTML and CSS**.

## 💡 What I Learned

I built this project by following a video tutorial from the [CodeHelp - by Babbar](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeHelpByBabbar) Web Development Course. It helped me strengthen my understanding of:

- 🌐 **CSS Flexbox**  
- 🧱 **CSS Grid**  
- 📱 **Media Queries** (Responsive Design)
